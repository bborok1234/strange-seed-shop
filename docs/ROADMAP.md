## Strategic North Star / 전략적 북극성

이 저장소는 현재 하나의 레포 안에 두 프로젝트를 함께 담고 있다.

1. **게임 프로젝트**: `이상한 씨앗상회` — 첫 5분 안에 “얘 귀엽다. 하나만 더 키워볼까?”를 만들고, 이름 있는 생명체 수집과 오프라인 복귀 욕구를 검증한다.
2. **운영사 프로젝트**: 에이전트 네이티브 게임 스튜디오/운영사 — 에이전트가 issue intake, 우선순위 선정, 구현, 검증, draft PR, CI 복구, follow-up issue까지 안전하게 반복하는 운영 계층을 만든다.

공통 헌장은 `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`가 소유한다. 게임 작업은 재미와 수집 욕구를, 운영사 작업은 장시간 자율성과 증거 기반 복구 능력을 개선해야 한다.

| Run 4-hour supervised trial | todo | `reports/operations/operator-trial-*.md` | At least one complete issue-to-PR loop or an honest blocker report exists; no red PR is called complete |

## Milestone 8: Feedback + GTM Mock Intake

| Create 24h runbook | todo | `docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` | Start, monitor, recover, stop, and summarize procedures are explicit |
| Add daily operating report | todo | `reports/operations/daily-*.md` | Human can wake up and see completed work, failed work, open PRs, red checks, decisions, and next queue |
| Run 24h dry run without external credentials | todo | `reports/operations/operator-24h-*.md` | No production side effects; heartbeat, CI repair, issue/PR loop, and escalation behavior are evidenced |
| Prepare split-ready operator package | todo | docs/scripts package plan | Operator surfaces that should move to a future separate repo are inventoried |

## Current Next Action

`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`가 게임 프로젝트와 에이전트 네이티브 운영사 프로젝트의 공통 헌장으로 추가되었다. 다음 안전한 운영사 작업은 **Milestone 6: Ralph-Session Operating Company v0**의 첫 항목부터 시작해, 장시간 실행을 주장하기 전에 heartbeat, stuck report, CI repair loop, issue-to-PR evidence를 먼저 만드는 것이다.

1. Starter sprite batch evidence는 `items/0017-starter-seed-sprite-pipeline-first-batch.md`와 `scripts/check-sprite-batch.mjs`에 고정되어 있으며, 게임 작업은 계속 **이름 있는 생명체 수집**과 첫 5분 재미를 우선한다.
2. 첫 loop는 starter seed -> plant -> tap growth -> harvest -> named creature ownership -> album reward -> second plot/next collection goal 순서를 보존한다.
3. Issue #25/PR #26, Issue #27/PR #28, Issue #29/PR #30으로 운영사 루프, watchdog, trial dry-run이 닫혔고, 현재 안전한 후속 작업은 Issue #31 / `items/0022-supervised-2h-trial-readiness-gate.md`로 실제 2h run 전 readiness gate를 고정하는 것이다.
4. 24시간 봇, 고객 피드백 실채널, GTM 실게시, 광고/결제/계정/credential 사용은 Milestone 6-8의 안전 장치와 명시 승인이 생기기 전까지 금지한다.
5. 실제 결제, 로그인/account, ads SDK, external navigation, runtime image generation은 계속 제외한다.
